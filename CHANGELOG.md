# Changelog

All notable public SDK changes are recorded here.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-08-15

### TypeScript

- Added typed `assignUserTier` and `revertUserTier` management methods with explicit
  idempotency-key support, plus refreshed generated types from the frozen API contract.

### Swift

- Added the additive `resource_conflict` typed error used by global app ownership and
  tier-mutation idempotency conflicts. The Swift package remains an end-user data-plane
  client; management mutations stay server-side.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-26

Initial public release for `Weirgate-Api-Version: 2026-07-18`.

### TypeScript

- Typed feature catalog, balance, chat, streaming, embeddings, usage, and client
  telemetry workflows.
- Stable `WeirgateError` values with request and API-version correlation.
- Automatic mutation idempotency, ETag-aware catalog reads, and verified SSE
  termination.
- ESM and CommonJS builds with bundled declarations.

### Swift

- `WeirgateKit` for iOS 17+ and macOS 14+.
- Authenticated catalog, balance, chat, streaming, typed errors, request correlation,
  output contracts, and client TTFT telemetry.
- Ephemeral per-call user-provider credentials with no URL cache.
- Root Swift package manifest for tagged Git URL resolution.

No server API change is included in this release.
